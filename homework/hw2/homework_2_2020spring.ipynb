    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will explore real-world challenges of building a graph (in this case, from tweets), implement and test the classic PageRank algortihm over this graph. In addition, you will apply learning to rank to a real-world dataset and report the performance in terms of NDCG.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw2.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw2.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 2 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the 5 total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

    "# Part 1: PageRank (60 points)\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic PageRank approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find significant Twitter users. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1.1: A re-Tweet Graph (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Twitter users and their retweets of other Twitter users (so user = node, retweet of another user = edge). Over this Twitter-user graph, we can apply the PageRank approach to order the users. The main idea is that a user who is retweeted by other users is more \"impactful\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four retweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **userID**: diane, **text**: \"RT \", **sourceID**: bob\n",
    "* **userID**: charlie, **text**: \"RT Welcome\", **sourceID**: alice\n",
    "* **userID**: bob, **text**: \"RT Hi \", **sourceID**: diane\n",
    "* **userID**: alice, **text**: \"RT Howdy!\", **sourceID**: parisa\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four short tweets retweeted by four users. The retweet between users form a directed graph with five nodes and four edges. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the tweets in the file we provide called *PageRank.json*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may see some weird characters in the content of tweets, just ignore them. \n",
    "* The edges are binary and directed. If Bob retweets Alice once, in 10 tweets, or 10 times in one tweet, there is an edge from Bob to Alice, but there is not an edge from Alice to Bob.\n",
    "* If a user retweets herself, ignore it.\n",
    "* Correctly parsing screen_name in a tweet is error-prone. Use the id of the user (this is the user who is re-tweeting) and the id of the user in the retweeted_status field (this is the user who is being re-tweeted; that is, this user created the original tweet).\n",
    "* Later you will need to implement the PageRank algorithm on the graph you build here.\n"
