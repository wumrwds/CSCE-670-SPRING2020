    "# Homework 4:  Word Embeddings for Information Retrieval and Query Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 100 points [5% of your final grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: April 28, 2020 by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will improve your information retrieval engine in homework 1 by word embeddings to: (i) directly match the query and the document in the latent semantic space of word embeddings; (ii) expand the original query via word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission instructions (eCampus):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw4.ipynb`. For example, my homework submission would be something like `555001234_hw4.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via eCampus (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use as many late days as you like (up to the total allotted to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

    "## Part 0. Dataset and Parsing (The same as Homework 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is collected from Quizlet (https://quizlet.com), a website where users can generated their own flashcards. Each flashcard generated by a user is made up of an entity on the front and a definition describing or explaining the entity correspondingly on the back. We treat entities on each flashcard's front as the queries and the definitions on the back of flashcards as the documents. Definitions (documents) are relevant to an entity (query) if the definitions are from the back of the entity's flashcard; otherwise definitions are not relevant. **In this homework, queries and entities are interchangeable as well as documents and definitions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the dataset is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**query \\t document id \\t document**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "decision tree\t\\t 27946 \\t\tshow complex processes with multiple decision rules.  display decision logic (if statements) as set of (nodes) questions and branches (answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "where \"decision tree\" is the entity in the front of a flashcard and \"show complex processes with multiple decision rules.  display decision logic (if statements) as set of (nodes) questions and branches (answers).\" is the definition on the flashcard's back and \"27946\" is the id of the definition. Naturally, this document is relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "false positive rate\t\\t 686\t\\t fall-out; probability of a false alarm\n",
    "\n",
    "where document 686 is not relevant to query \"decision tree\" because the entity of \"fall-out; probability of a false alarm\" is \"false positive rate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For parsing this dataset, you could also just copy your code from homework 1 to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "* Tokenize documents (definitions) using **whitespaces and punctuations as delimiters**.\n",
    "* Remove stop words: use nltk stop words list (from nltk.corpus import stopwords)\n",
    "* Stemming: use [nltk Porter stemmer](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.html#module-nltk.stem.porter)\n",
    "* Remove any other strings that you think are less informative or nosiy."

    "Because different queries have different numbers of related documents. The query with more related documents may have a larger precision or NDCG. So in order to eliminate the influence of this factor when comparing the results before query expansion and after query expansion, we'd better use recall instead of precision or NDCG."
